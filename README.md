## Technologies Used
- Swift programming language
- SwiftUI or UIKit for user interface
- Core Data for local data storage
- Third-party libraries:
  - Alamofire for network requests
  - SDWebImage for image handling
  - MapKit for location-based features
- MVC or MVVM architectural pattern
- CI/CD using GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tool
- Unit tests and UI tests
- Apple's Face ID API for facial recognition

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Xcode
3. Build and run the app on a simulator or connected device

## Design Choices and Trade-offs
- Used SwiftUI for building the user interface to leverage its declarative syntax and simplify UI development
- Implemented Core Data for local data persistence to allow offline access and fast data retrieval
- Integrated third-party libraries to speed up development and add robust functionality
- Followed MVVM architectural pattern to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability
- Set up CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated builds and tests to catch issues early
- Implemented basic facial recognition using Face ID API for an additional layer of app security
- Focused on delivering core features and meeting requirements within the given timeframe, while leaving room for future enhancements

## Future Improvements
- Implement cloud sync feature using Firebase or iCloud for seamless cross-device task management
- Add more animations and custom UI components to enhance the user experience
- Provide localization support for multiple languages to cater to a wider audience
- Explore machine learning capabilities to offer intelligent task suggestions and reminders based on user behavior
